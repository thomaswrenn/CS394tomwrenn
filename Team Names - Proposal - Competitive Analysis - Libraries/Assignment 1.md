# Competitive Analysis
## Social Media
Social media like pinterest, instagram, tumblr and the dedicated blogs and tools that piggyback on these systems are major competitions. Our app wants to be able to share and distribute different date ideas. We will offer tools that enable users to tag and link to useful sources of information like yelp menus, location data and maps, as well as feature prominent, picture albums, all features tuned for mobile. The popularity of the current trending social media platforms could stifle our growth by providing ‘good enough’ sporadic date ideas (esp. pinterest) through a web interface. On the mobile platform, interface design and the connectivity to other social media, Instagram is on top of it all. Our idea needs to be refreshing and simple, simple and refreshing in a way that the pictures and postings will take all the attention on mobile.

Would it be smart to include features that allow us to piggyback on Instagram’s success by allowing users to post summary photo collages (like all the photo and video collage instagram apps) that somehow link to our app (does instagram even allow links? maybe not. if not maybe facebook?) This could devalue our app heavily though, may be a desperate strategy saved for down the line if growth is unsatisfactory. Cross posting in the most basic form will be integral though.

## HowAboutWe
Merchant-controlled, has name recognition, doesn’t have mobile app, location based. They’re splitting their brand and efforts between couples and singles. They have very different experiences for each. The singles one is basically just a dating site while the couples one is more like peek and doesn’t have a mobile experience. (singles does, each site has different user databases!)

## peek
Merchant-controlled, unconfirmed name recognition, simple and clean mobile experience, location-based.

Both of the above apps (HowAboutWe Couples and peek) are merchant controlled and do not have the faces of your friends, trusted experts or neighbors behind them. Our
Non-location based Date Idea ‘providers’
The following blog is an interesting case to study in non-location based date idea publishing. thedatingdivas.com The approach towards these types of date ideas may demand different tools (similar to Instructables) that are hopefully complementary and not competing. It will be challenging to balance these types of dates against the location based and experience-photo based ideas. In the end we will hold the __location-based ideas__ as the __primary__ use case because of the awe factor (word of mouth marketing, lend themselves to breathtaking photos) and because of __the apparent monetization path__ demonstrated by the merchant-controlled competition.

# UX
## UX Design Inspirations
- Instagram (Feed)
- Facebook’s Paper (Diving into the details of an item and navigating out of and inside the item) 
- Tumblr 
- Behance 

## Yelp vs Google or Foursquare
Yelp encourages restaurants vs Google and Foursquare lacking data like hours + menu + more pictures of venue.

Both provide concrete street address vs geolocation
Problems, these services associate point-based location to merchants when places like Central Park or a mall or amusement park don’t work well with that way of storing location. (filter out certain types of locations [w/o street address? marked as park??] and use geo as location for these instead? OR when user sets or edits location, they can move the pointer away from the service-provided location as well as manually change the address or set with freeform instructions on how to get there [imagine like special place in a national park])
